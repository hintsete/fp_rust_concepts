# Functional Programming in Rust

This project demonstrates functional programming concepts implemented in Rust, based on a training session focusing on `map` and `compose`. Additional concepts explored during the session (e.g., `Option`, `Result`) are included to show my understanding.

## Implemented Concepts
- **Map**: Transforms a vector using a pure function (`map.rs` equivalent).
- **Function Composition**: Combines two functions (`compose.rs` equivalent).
- **Recursion**: Computes factorial immutably.
- **Pure Function**: Computes square with no side effects.
- **Sum**: Reduces a vector to a single value.
- **Currying**: Transforms a multi-argument function into nested single-argument functions.
- **Enum**: Defines `Option` and `Result` for state machines.
- **Pattern Matching**: Handles `Option<Human>` cases.
